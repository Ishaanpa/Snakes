<p>Your parents have sent you to your grandmother’s home with the hopes to correct some of your disruptive behavior. While you’re here, your childhood playmate arrives. She is your cousin from which you get along with very well.</p>
	<ul>
		<li> <p>You decide to explore the interior of the house with your cousin to see what there is to do inside your grandmother’s home.<br>You find that there is very little to do inside the house except for reading books inside of the library.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>You decide that it would be more fun to go outside than it would be to sit inside and read books.<br>You explore the neighborhood around your grandmother’s home and find that there is a nearby lake which is very fun to explore and swim in. Your cousin challenges you to a tree climbing contest with the tree hanging over the lake for fall protection.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>You say that this is a great idea and race her up the tree.<br>Near the top you lose your balance and push her off.  She falls into the lake and hits her head on a submerged rock. She goes to the hospital.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>You are blamed for pushing your cousin out of the tree. After your cousin’s parents come and pick her up, your grandmother disciplines you very harshly for hurting your cousin.</li>
							</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>You don’t believe this is a good idea so you watch as she races to the top of the tree.<br>She loses her balance near the top and she falls into the lake while hitting her head on a submerged rock at the bottom. She goes to the hospital.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>You are blamed for not stopping your cousin and keeping them out of the tree which would’ve kept her from falling. After your cousin’s parents come and pick her up, your grandmother disciplines you very harshly for not taking care of your cousin.</li>

					<li><p>You decide that your cousin won’t be safe on her own so you will go with her to keep her from getting into trouble.<br>You explore the neighborhood around your grandmother’s home and find that there is a nearby lake which is very fun to explore and swim in. You and your cousin climb a tree and swing on a branch but you lose your balance and push her.  She falls into the lake and hits her head on a submerged rock. She goes to the hospital.</p>

					<li><p>You believe that your cousin will be completely fine by herself and there isn’t any reason for you to accompany her outside.<br>Later that evening your grandmother gets a call that your cousin has fallen out of a tree into the lake. Upon hitting the water, her spine made contact with a rock and she was knocked unconscious. Luckily a passerby watched her fall so she was rushed to the hospital before she could drown in the lake. </p>
