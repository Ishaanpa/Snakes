	<p>You must assume that you are playing the role of the grandmother of a child</p>
</header>
<div id="sections">
<p>You are a grandparent whose spouse has passed away. Your daughter, whom you have not spoken to in years, is letting you take care of her own daughter while she and her husband take a cruise trip off the coast of Brazil.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You do not know how to treat your granddaughter.
			<ul>
				<li><p>Over the weeks, your granddaughter treats you with disrespect. You discipline her with the hope that she will learn to respect her elders.<br>You start by telling her about snakes that were brought from another country. These snakes mated and have created babies that have grown to be able to eat dogs of nearby neighbors. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Your granddaughter listens to you and stays inside the house. She does not go out and is afraid of showering and going anywhere by herself. She is afraid of sleeping in her bed and sleeps on the floor instead. <br>You feel bad for how she has been traumatized by your lie about the snake’s existence. You tell her that there really aren’t any snakes around that could harm her and that the entire thing was a story to get her to respect you.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>She doesn’t believe you and stays like this all summer; she becomes an introvert. She chooses not to go anywhere during the summer and stays inside always. She becomes all pale and white by living in the shadows of the house, when her mother comes back she finds a pale child who look lifeless. Your daughter is mortified by what you have done and decides to cut all ties with you.</li>
							</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>Your granddaughter listens to you and stays inside the house and studies. She does everything her you ask of her. She is like a child robot waiting to complete the next task when you give her. <br>You feel bad for how she has been traumatized by your lie about the snake’s existence. You tell her that there really aren’t any snakes around that could harm her and that the entire thing was a story to get her to respect you.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>At the end of the summer when her mother decides to pick her up she finds that her daughter has become like herself. She is very diligent and respectful. She finds that the daughter is not disrespectful toward elders but has become deathly scared of snakes. The daughter is very robotic and her brain works like a machine with no emotion.</li>
							</ul>
					</li>
					
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><p>Over the weeks your granddaughter treats you with respect but does not really want to talk with you.<br>You spend the next few days trying to have her warm up to you. You take her around shopping and take her to the country club to swim. She does not seem to be enjoying herself. </p>
					<ul>
					<li><p>You try your best to make her happy but she is just like her mother. She likes playing out on the tree branches and having wild free nature. She does not like having a reserved nature. <br>You tell her to stop climbing trees because you are scared for her welfare. You don’t want her to fall and get hurt. To keep her busy, you play cards with her every morning and evening to keep her from climbing the trees nearby.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>As the summer comes along, she respects you, but continues to do her own thing quietly. When her mother comes to pick her up she is very happy to see her. All of a sudden she is gone before you know it, like she was never here in the first place.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>You are not able to make her happy and as the summer comes a long she starts to go and hangout with the neighbors. You start to barely see her, and do not know where she is half of the time.<br> You caution your granddaughter that she needs to stay nearby otherwise you won’t be able to keep an eye on her to protect her. She continues running off whenever you turn your back on her which leaves you worried about her health. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>The day her parents come to pick her up is when she hurts herself by falling of a tree because she was having a dare with her friends. You daughter blames you for not taking care of her daughter and decides to cut all ties with you.</li>
							</ul>
					</li>
										</ul>
				</li>
				
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><p>You treat her daughter with disrespect.<br>You spend the next few weeks relaxing and enjoying yourself making your granddaughter do your chores for you. You don’t give her any attention other than to keep her busy on chores and even when something is done properly you make her do it a couple more times to teach her to respect you.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Your granddaughter is so mad at you that she runs away from your room. You decide that you need to go out and find her before something happens that you cannot fix.<br>You search everywhere near your home and haven’t found her. You get the idea that she may have run to the lake to have some fun climbing the trees over the water or swim to clear her head. You find her laying face up in the water underneath a tree whose branches stretch over a small portion of the lake.</p>
					<ul>
					<li><p>You call to her to get her attention.<br>She is unresponsive. You trod out into the lake to go and see what’s wrong. You find that she has hit her head on a rock submerged beneath the water and she needs to be rushed to the hospital. You call for an ambulance and paramedics arrive and take her to the nearest hospital for treatment. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>You call her parents and they rush back to find their daughter in the hospital with damage to her spine. She will never walk again. Your daughter blames you for her daughter’s injury and decides to cut all ties with you because whenever you are around, something always goes wrong.</li>
							</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>You rest assured that she is just taking a swim and sit down on a fallen tree nearby so that you can watch her.<br>She hasn’t moved after 10 minutes, you call to her but she doesn’t respond. You trod out into the lake to go and see what’s wrong. You find that she has hit her head on a rock submerged beneath the water and she needs to be rushed to the hospital. You call for an ambulance and paramedics arrive and take her to the nearest hospital for treatment.</p>
