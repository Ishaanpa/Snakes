	<p>You must assume that you are playing the role of a daughter</p>
</header>
<div id="sections">
<p>Your parents are going on a cruise trip off the coast of Brazil. They have decided to let your grandmother take care of you while they are gone even though your grandmother has been known to be harsh and hate on your mother. You decide you will take your family issues into your own hands so the family will live happily ever after.<br>You go to your grandma’s house over the summer to try to bring your family back together, but you find it will be much harder than anticipated. What was said about your grandmother was very true and you might never figure out how to fix this.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>You can give up on your plan and try to call your mom to go back home.<br>Your grandma quickly becomes furious at you and punishes you by cutting off your fresh haircut that was just done perfectly before you went to your grandmother’s.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>You run away and hope to find someone who can help you get away from your grandmother’s house.<br>As you run away, you find a black man (the same race as you) who seems to care very much about you. He offers you a place to stay and a possible job opportunity.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>You take the deal and decide you can make some extra money to help pay for law school you always had wanted to do<br>You find out this was a very bad choice as this man has forced you into sex trafficking. As time passes, you become brainwashed and eventually become the trafficker yourself. This ends you up in jail and a life that relies on the government for money and a fight just to make ends meet.</p></li>
					<li><p>You come to the conclusion that this man is very sketchy and you run back to your grandma’s house.<br>When you get back, you assume your grandmother will be happy with you because you came back, but instead you are beaten with a belt and have to deal with it every day for the rest of the summer.</p></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><p>You decide to get revenge on your grandmother to let her know who she is dealing with by stealing things from her bedroom and putting them in different spots in the yard or selling them to anybody you can find so you can possibly make some extra money for law school you had always wanted to go to.<br>It is all fun and games until Grandma starts wondering where her things have gone and catches you one day in the act.</p>
					<ul>
					<li><p>When she asks what you are doing, you make up an excuse saying you didn’t know it was hers.<br>Grandma doesn’t buy the excuse one bit and she takes you to the bedroom to hit you with her belt. . . multiple times. You have to deal with this every day for the rest of the summer.</p></li>
					<li><p>You decide lying will not help in this situation and let her know the truth.<br>Grandma becomes extremely furious and decides you have to stay in your room for the rest of the summer. Every time you come out, you are beaten with a belt. You have to deal with this every day for the rest of the summer.</p></li>
										</ul>
				</li>
				
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><p>You decide not to give up and pass time by just having fun with your cousin staying with you as well.<br>This is a great time at first as you find many fun things to do in the backyard, woods, and lake that surround the complex your grandmother lives in. Unfortunately, Grandma doesn’t like how much you guys are running around so she tells you about the Burmese Pythons running around town that have eaten a dog and will attack you from the lake or the walls of the house if you get too close. This scares you to death.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>You decide to stand in the middle of every room of the house so no pythons will get you and cannot sleep in your own bed, or really at all for that matter.<br>Even though this really is not at all a good experience for you, you are obeying your grandma very well and are not having many more punishments. You still are afraid of the snakes, though, and are looking for anything that will make you feel more confident that you will not be eaten. Finally, your grandma tells you that you and your cousin are going to go swimming. How do you respond?</p>
					<ul>
					<li><p>You keep saying that the snakes will eat you if you go swimming, and so your grandma tells you she lied to you about the snakes. You and your cousin become angry and decide to run to the lake to have fun like you used to again.<br>You fall off a tree into the lake and hit your head on a rock. You have to stay in the hospital for multiple days, but it finally gets you out of staying at your grandma’s house. You go on to become a lawyer with great education, but the events that happened that summer effect you for the rest of your life and you end up with trust issues for your boyfriends, parents, and anybody else you have a relationship with. This is the best outcome possible for this character</p></li>
					<li><p>You tell them you are not going.<br>This disappoints your cousin and enrages your grandmother. Your cousin goes off to swim after you are punished with a belt and have to stay in your room every day for the rest of the summer at her house.</p></li>
					
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><p>You decide to stay with your grandma because you love your mom, but you have a very bad attitude towards your grandmother when you arrive.<br>It does not start well for you as you decide to give your grandma attitude at the airport and immediately give your grandma an excuse to give you a nightmare over the summer. When you get to her house, you are not allowed to see your cousin who was a good friend and would be staying with you. Instead, you are put in your own room and are commanded not to come out unless called upon. If you disobey, you will get punished with a belt and have to deal with it every day for the rest of the summer.</p>
